SThis is part of Cloudera Introduction to Hadoop and MapReduce course.
For the data file purchases.txt I have implemented the below 4 mapper/reducer functions:
      ItemSalesMapper.py
      ItemSalesReducer.py
      StoreMaxSaleMapper.py
      StoreMaxSaleReducer.py
For the data file access_log I have implemented the below 4 mapper/reducer functions:
      AccessLogIpHitMapper.py
      AccessLogIpHitReducer.py
      AccessLogPageHitMapper.py
      AccessLogPageHitReducer.py
      
Some problems where map reduce can be found helpful:
1)Filtering problems:
        Simple Filter
        Bloom Filter
        Sampling
        Random Sampling
        Top 10 of something
 2)Summarization Patterns:
        Inverted Index
        Finding mean,median,mode,sum
